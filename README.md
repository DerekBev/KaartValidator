# Suggested Settings
## JOSM
In JOSM Preferences, go to "Advanced Preferences" and change "mirror.maxtime"
from "604800" (7 days)to "14400" (4 hours). This number is seconds between
update checks for _any_ mirror that you have in preferences. In my preferences
file, there were about 25 external files. Please _do not_ set it any lower than
4 hours (14400 seconds).
